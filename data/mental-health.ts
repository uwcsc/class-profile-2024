There are people who care, but the system is built so that YOU have to find them, and for people already struggling, this is a huge barrier to them getting help.",

Coop terms also helped a lot - I definitely grew the most as a software engineer at work.",

However, I don't think I was ever intimidated because I always focused on myself. I pursued my interest, explored where I want to be, and as university went on I had a clearer vision of it. For example, I realized half way through uni that I am more interested in product design rather than coding, so I built a portfolio and a personal website, switched my job search routines, then started working in UX/UI design. Some people would tell me “designers don't earn as much”, or “it's a waste of your CS degree, look at how others in your program are already getting dev offers from big tech firms”, etc. I am really glad I didn't get intimidated by these negative comments because I love my new job as a designer. The knowledge from my CS degree still comes in handy at work!",
  "Throughout university, you will hear a lot about people getting offers from big Cali companies or the phrase “Cali or Bust” (which is not true, you can find good jobs anywhere!) Instead of listening to others, it's more helpful to just focus on yourself. I don't really feel imposter syndrome because I try to enjoy the most of my life including my job, and I am satisfied with where I am. I also think that everyone lives and grows at their own pace, sometimes we are so focused on others' achievements and tend to ignore our own growth. Last but not least, it's essential to keep a positive attitude. I try to see others' achievements more as ways to motivate myself. I believed in my own capabilities or at least I believe that if I keep trying, I will reach my goals eventually. And that really helped me throughout university.",
  "One of my big insecurities is that I only get jobs because I'm a woman in CS and I'm not actually good enough and just there as a diversity hire",
  "Think I was just placing too much of my self-worth into my grades, especially cause grades are such an easy concrete way you can compare yourself to your peers and feel less than. Truthfully, I think one of the big things I did was I just started being up front with myself and my friends about my weaknesses. It was when my grades were always a secret and a source of shame that I felt so horrible and my self esteem went down the drain. After I just started telling people the truth (parents and friends included) and just telling myself that it was okay that I wasn't the best student anymore as long as I was giving it my best, I just felt this huge burden being lifted off me. And in a weird way, once I accepted that it was okay that I wasn't the best when it came to studying for calculus tests or if certain topics didn't come easy to me, I was able to put that energy into actually learning and that's why I really saw my marks improve in my later uni years. Additionally, I just learned how to be patient with myself when learning and got better at setting study goals, organizing my time, and figuring out what studying techniques worked for me. So overall, I think what I learned over university is self-acceptance, patience, and learning how to feel confident even while being honest with myself and others about my shortcomings.",

The people who worked at Wish, Google, Microsoft, or other US companies were all kind of mini celebrities in the CS circles. I think there's really no way to cope. Part of it is improving and working on yourself and part of it is accepting that there will always be people who are better.",
  "Sometimes, it feels like I'm not good enough for something after seeing many students in the same year as me get good co-op and internships.",
  "I realized most people feel similarly, but it's not outwardly visible. Everyone shows their best side in a professional setting. Also I'm at the beginning of my career. I have a lot of time to learn.",
  "When I first got to university, I immediately realized that I'm now surrounded by individuals just as if not more capable, driven, and talented as I am. And I came to the conclusion that clinging on to the same high-school mindset of being \"the best\" is counterproductive and detrimental to mental health. Not sure if I can say I overcame it, but some ways that helped me through was to first ditch my ego and second understand that being surrounded by people smarter than me means I'm leading and improving myself, it means that I have much more to gain. However, eventually you will realize most if not all other people have the exact same feeling, they might feel that they aren't as capable as YOU are. So it is really helpful to talk to your friends and peers to gain an understanding of their perspective :).",
  "Seeing numerous LinkedIn posts about people who bragged about their coop really made it worse. I overcame by talking to more people about it.",
