            Even though the vast majority of respondents stayed on track with their initial plans, it is also perfectly normal to deviate from the planned route
            for a degree. Some students may have either shortened their degree by, for example, removing co-op from their degree or taking more classes than a
            full course load per term. Meanwhile, others may have delayed their graduation by retaking failed classes, taking gap years, adding minors to their

              Because of the breadth and depth requirements for UW&apos;s computer science degrees, students are required to take electives in varying subject
              areas. Out of the different elective categories, communications and humanities courses were the most preferred, followed by courses in the social
              sciences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The popularity of these subject areas is likely due to the content taught in these courses being vastly different from the content in the required
              math and computer science courses, as well as their lower difficulty, allowing for a more refreshing studying experience.

              Software Engineering and CS are programs in which the students eventually end up in similar jobs and post-grad roles, thus, some of them may have

            A major reason behind why many of the students transferred into computer science was because they were not as interested in their previous major
            compared to their current one. Two other popular reasons for students transferring into computer science were to improve future job prospects and to
            have a more flexible schedule and course requirements.

            Second year seemed to be the most difficult for the most students, with 2A, followed by 2B, being considered the most difficult study terms. This
            could be due to that many of the least favoured courses and courses considered to be the most difficult, such as CS 245 and MATH 239, would have
            been taken during the students&apos; 2A or 2B study term.

            <p>
              The 4A and 4B study terms were considered to be the easiest study terms by a large margin. This is likely due to most of the more difficult core
              courses being finished already and students being able to take electives that they are more interested in once all the mandatory courses had been
              completed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This statistic highlights that even though classes may get harder (in 2A and 2B), it will get better after it gets worse, and that we should
              persevere through the challenges that may arise during our undergraduate careers!
